This allows you to perform other Git operations such as adding, committing, pushing, pulling changes, and more.

## Connecting to Remote Repository

Once you have initialized your collection, the next step is to connect it to a remote Git repository.
You can directly connect to remote repository from Bruno using Git GUI feature.

To connect Bruno to GitHub, you need to set up either an SSH key or a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub. Follow this [official GitHub guide <strong><sup>â†—</sup></strong>](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to set it up.

1. Create empty Git repository on your GitHub.
2. Open **Git initialized** Bruno collection.
3. Click on **Quick Links** (bottom-left corner).
4. Select **Remotes** from the dropdown.

After completing the above steps, your collection will be connected to GitHub. We have to **add and commit** (see below) some changes to pushed collection to GitHub.


Once your collection is connected to the remote repository, you can manage it directly from the Bruno app.

By following these steps, your changes are now committed and tracked in Git, ready to be pushed or shared with others.

## Pushing and Pulling Changes

The GUI-based Git integration in Bruno allows both engineering and non-engineering teams to work together in a fast, efficient, and accurate manner. This integration ensures that your collections remain consistently up-to-date across all team members.
