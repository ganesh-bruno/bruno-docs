# Send Request

Bruno VS Code extension allows you to send API requests directly from your editor. This feature integrates seamlessly with your development workflow, enabling you to test APIs without leaving your coding environment.

## Create Request

You can create requests by navigating to the Bruno extension:

- Click on **New Request** 
- Provide request `name` and `URL` 

To create a new collection, you can press the **"+"** button and provide a location to store it. Once you have a collection, you can create folders, configure settings, and organize your requests.

You can also open existing collections from your system by simply opening the collection folder in the editor.

## Create Environment

To create a new environment:

- Click on **No Environment**
- Go to **Configure** (Global or Collection) as per your preference
- Enter name for the environment and create values
- Set up variables for different environments (dev, staging, production)

If you have Collection environments in Bruno, the extension will automatically pick them up from the environment folder.

[Global environment](../variables/global-environment-variables.mdx) variables created within the app are not accessible in the extension due to security reasons. However, you can create and use them as needed in the extension.
