# Install and Configure

To start using the Bruno VS Code extension, install it from the official [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bruno-api-client.bruno), or simply open the Extensions panel in your editor and search for **Bruno**.

Once installed, open a Bruno collection and begin sending API requests right from your editor.

## Usage

### Dual View Mode

Bruno VS Code extension offers two distinct viewing modes to suit different workflows:

1. **Using the Explorer** - File mode with syntax highlighting
2. **Using the Extension** - GUI mode with visual interface

### Using the Explorer

If you already have loaded Bruno collection into the editor the File mode will be default view to switch GUI mode click on **Bruno** icon.

### Using the Extension

By clicking the extension in VS Code, you will have a similar experience to the Bruno Desktop App.
To switch between view modes, click the arrow icons in the top right of your editor.

## Working with Collections

Similar to the desktop application, the extension will first start as a clean slate. Click the "+" icon to either open, create, or import a collection.
