# Install and Configure

To start using the Bruno VS Code extension, install it from the official [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bruno-api-client.bruno), or simply open the Extensions panel in your editor and search for **Bruno**.

Once installed, open a Bruno collection and begin sending API requests right from your editor.

## Usage

### Dual View Mode

With the extension installed, if you open any `.bru` files in Explorer the default view mode will be file mode with syntax highlighting.

If you're using the extension directly, the default view mode will be the Bruno GUI.

To switch between view modes, click the arrow icons in the top right of your editor.

### Using the Extension

By clicking the extension in VS Code, you will have a similar experience to the Bruno Desktop App.

### Using Collections

Similar to the desktop application, the extension will first start as a clean slate. Click the "+" icon to either open, create, or import a collection.
