gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a modern, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It's designed for efficient communication when one service needs to interact with another.

Imagine your Authentication Service needs to tell your Notification Service to send an OTP. In a high-traffic scenario, traditional request-response calls (like REST over HTTP/1.1) can be less efficient and introduce latency.

gRPC solves this by faster communication, efficient data transfer and streaming capabilities.
