# gRPC Proto Files

Proto files (`.proto`) are the foundation of gRPC services, defining the contract between clients and servers. Bruno supports adding proto files to enhance your gRPC development experience with better IntelliSense, method discovery, and type safety.

## Adding Proto Files

1. Open your gRPC request in Bruno
2. In the gRPC interface, locate the **Using Reflection** section
3. Click on the **Select Proto File** button or toggle the proto file option
4. Click the file browser to select `.proto` files from your local system

Bruno will validate that the selected files are valid proto files.
You can add multiple proto files if your service uses imports or multiple definitions.
