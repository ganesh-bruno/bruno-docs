# gRPC Request

Bruno provides comprehensive support for gRPC requests, enabling you to test and interact with gRPC services directly from the interface. With Bruno's gRPC support, you can:

- **Add Proto files** for enhanced IntelliSense and method discovery
- **Use Server Reflection** as an alternative to Proto files for automatic method suggestions
- **Call server methods** with full parameter support and type validation
- **Test real-time streaming APIs** including unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming

## gRPC Interface

Bruno gRPC interface provides an intuitive way to interact with gRPC services. The interface automatically adapts based on whether you're using Proto files or Server Reflection.

### Step 3: Configure the Request
 
1. Click on **Reflection** and choose the **method** you want to call from the dropdown

<Callout type="important"> 
   **Refresh**: The gRPC refresh feature caches server information in memory for better performance. If you're running a local gRPC server and make changes to your service definitions, click the **Refresh** button next to the **Using Reflection** toggle to reload the latest changes from your server.
</Callout>

2. Add any **required inputs** in the message section (auto generate with **Auto Fill** button)
