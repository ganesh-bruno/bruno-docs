# REST API request

Bruno enables you to send API requests using both HTTP and GraphQL protocols. You can include various details in the request, such as parameters, body, headers, and more, based on the API specifications.
You can select multiple HTTP methods such as `GET` and `POST` while working with HTTP protocol.

## Create new request

1. Create new request inside collection.
2. Select **HTTP** as request type.
3. Provide **URL** and **Name** in the input box.
4. Click on **Create** button.

## Select multiple request methods

In Bruno, the **GET** method is set as the default HTTP method for new requests. However, you can select other HTTP methods (such as **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, etc.) based on your API requirements to send data.
