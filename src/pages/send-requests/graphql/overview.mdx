# Overview

Bruno can send requests using GraphQL, an open-source query language and runtime for APIs.

## GraphQL request

GraphQL APIs let clients request only the data they need through a single endpoint. Itâ€™s schema-driven, allowing clients to introspect and avoid overfetching or underfetching data. Each GraphQL request has a URL (the data endpoint) and a query (defining the data to retrieve or modify).

The API schema defines available fields, and the request may include authentication, headers, and settings as needed.

GraphQL requests support three operations:

- **Query**: Retrieves data, specifying fields and optional arguments for precise results.

- **Mutation**: Modifies data (create, update, delete), with specified fields returned after the operation.

- **Subscription**: Provides real-time updates by listening for changes to specific data fields over a persistent connection.
