Bruno DevTools offers variety of features such as:

### Features of Dev Utils:

#### 1. Prettify JSON

This feature formats and organizes your JSON data in a more readable, indented way. It helps you easily view the structure and nested elements of complex JSON responses, making it easier to debug and inspect the data.

#### 2. Convert JSON to YAML

Bruno allows you to convert JSON data into YAML format. YAML is often easier to read and work with, especially when dealing with large configurations or settings. This feature is useful for converting API responses or payloads between the two formats.

#### 3. Decode JWT

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are commonly used for authentication. Bruno's JWT Decoder allows you to decode and inspect the contents of a JWT, including its header, payload, and signature. This helps in debugging authentication issues by allowing you to verify the tokenâ€™s data.
