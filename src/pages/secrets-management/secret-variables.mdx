# Secrets Management

## Secret Variables

<Callout type="info">
Bruno stores secrets on your local machine. The location depends on the OS.
The secrets are encrypted using OS level encryption when available or falls back to AES256 encryption.
</Callout>

In this approach, you can check the `secret` checkbox for any variable in your environment.
Bruno will manage your secrets internally and will not write them into the environment file.

Your environment file at `environments/local.bru` would look like
```bash filename="local.bru"
vars {
  url: https://echo.usebruno.com
}
vars:secret [
  jwt-token
]

```

And now you can safely check in your collection to source control without worrying about exposing your secrets.

When you export your collection as a file, Bruno will not export the secret variables.
