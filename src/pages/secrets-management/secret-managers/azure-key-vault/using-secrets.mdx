## Using Secrets in Request Fields

Secrets are accessed in the same way as collection and environment variables. The secrets can be accessed in headers, query, body, auth input fields similar to collection and environment variables.

Secrets need to be prefixed with `$secrets` followed by the `secret name` and then the `key name`, all separated by periods.

<Callout type="important">
Pattern: `{{$secrets`.`<secret-name>`.`<key-name>}}`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  If you have a secret named dbCredentials with a key username, you can reference it as: `{{$secrets.dbCredentials.username}}`
</Callout>

## Using Secrets in Scripts

You can also access secrets from within Pre-request and Post-request scripts using the `bru.getSecretVar()` function.

```javascript
const secretValue = bru.getSecretVar('<secret-name>.<key-name>');
console.log(secretValue); // This will log the value of your secret

// Example: Using Azure Key Vault secrets in authentication
const apiKey = bru.getSecretVar('azure-secrets.api-key');
req.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + apiKey);
```


Make sure your Azure Key Vault secret provider is properly configured and the secrets are fetched before using them in scripts. Verify that the secret names and key names match exactly with your Azure Key Vault configuration.
